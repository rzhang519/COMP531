<p> During my last trip, I went to central America, visting Costa Rica, Cuba and Mexico. It was a lof fun to experience different cultures and tried different local foods. The people, in general, are very friendly and warm. It was also an interesting experience traveling in places where no effecitve communication can be made due to the language barrier. We visited some ancient building as well as lots of wonderful beaches and mountains. It was still pretty hot even in January so we did some scuba diving which is an awesome experinence</p>
